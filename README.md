# Bingo

## Let's play a game of home-made bingo!!!ðŸ˜œ

To see that we have understood the phases of programming we are going to program a bingo!



- When starting the page:
  - The upper part "**Balls**" must be empty.
  - The bottom part "**My card**" should show 20 randomly generated numbers between 1 and 100.
- Then:
  - Every time we click on the button "**Draw a ball**" we should generate and display a new random number from 1 to 100 in the "**Balls**" part.
  - Highlight with a green background the number of our cardboard that matches the ball drawn. If it doesn't match, then nothing.
  - As continually pressing the "**Draw a ball**" button is very tiring, when you press the play button once ``â–º`` a new ball will be generated every one second. Of course, the balls of my cardboard that come out will also have to be shown with a background.
- When all the balls of the numbers on our card have appeared, we must display the message "**Bingo has been called!!!**" and hide the "**Draw a ball**" and **Play buttons**.

Easy, isn't it!ðŸ˜Š
